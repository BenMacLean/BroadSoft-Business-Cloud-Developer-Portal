        <h1>1.0 Overview</h1>
        <p>UC-One Hub is a BroadSoft cloud service providing direct access to cloud applications that have been pre-integrated with UC-One – allowing users to be more efficient and productive. These integrations bring a lite client experience and contextual data to your day-to-day communications via UC-One.  UC-One Communicator for Desktop-Chrome is the first client to be integrated with Hub, with other client experiences to follow.</p>
        <p>
          To do this, Hub integrates into the Chrome client experience in three different ways, the MicroApp View, the Notification bar (which also serves as the navigation bar), and the Contextual data view.
          As you build your integration into Hub, your application data will be inserted through the use of a “webview” or iframe elements.
        </p>
        <p>Below is an illustration of how the three components of Hub (Notifications, Contextual, MicroApp) integrate into the UC-One Chrome experience.</p>
        <div class="col-sm-12"><img src="assets/images/image07.png" class="doc-image"/></div>
        <div id="Notifications" class="col-sm-6 new-sub-section">
          <h2>1.1 Notifications</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="assets/images/image08.png" class="doc-image"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>In the notifications bar, you’ll have an icon for your application, which will act as a reference point for application notifications and navigation. This view is always shown while communicator is open and provides users a heads-up view of items that require their action and a point to navigate to different applications.</p>
          <p>When a user clicks on the notifications icon that corresponds to your app, the MicroApp pane will then shift to your MicroApp pane regardless of where the user is in Communicator at the time.</p>
          <p>What can I set here?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              App icon for notification uploaded on app registration page (SVG, WOFF)
            </li>
            <li>This is elaborated in section 4.2</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="Contextual" class="col-sm-12 new-sub-section">
          <h2>1.2 Contextual</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>This panel is shown when an end user interacts with another user through a chat or phone call. When this happens, all enabled apps that have the contextual box checked under settings are sent a request for all user data that they want to display in the contextual view. This data can send a maximum of 30 items on first call with additional content made available utilizing the “more” function. The next request to your API will ask for the next page.</p>
          <p>You will be able to display data here in a container 228px by 70px in size. Your icon will also be used here. This is the default size of the window but keep in mind that the user can expand this window to any height while leaving the width constant.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"><img src="assets/images/image04.png" class="doc-image"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
        <div id="MicroApp" class="col-sm-12 new-sub-section">
          <h2>1.3 MicroApp</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>The micro app is where you can display any content that you would like for your application. You will display this information in the form of an iframe. The url of this iframe can be set when you register your application. It is a scrollable container and the header of this panel will have the name of the application that you registered with Hub. The settings link in the header takes you to the Hub settings page.</p>
          <p>The default size of this iframe is 288px by 470px. Users also have the ability to expand the window to any height that their monitor supports while maintaining a fixed width of 288px.</p>
          <p>There are a few iframes at work here that you may need to consider. The Communicator application provides Hub with three IFrames so Hub can display its content. As a third party developer, you will only be provided with one IFrame in which to display data (This is the MicroApp IFrame).</p>
          <p>All the IFrames in the application talk to each other through two APIs: the internal Hub API and the third party API. Public access is only provided for the third party API.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"><img src="assets/images/image02.png" class="doc-image"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
        <div id="BroadSearch" class="col-sm-12 new-sub-section">
          <h2>1.5 BroadSearch</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-11">
          <p>BroadSearch is one of the most important parts of Hub as it allows users to easily search through data between all integrations. These can be internal or external applications and allows Hub to combine data of all types in a global search.</p>
          <p>There are two places that the user can use the BroadSearch feature: In the micro apps view and in the contextual view. However, when the user searches in the micro apps view, only the current application is searched. In contextual however, search behaves on a more global level.</p>
          <p>In contextual, if you search the while in the “All” tab, you will search all applications at once. As you filter the contextual view to categories or subcategories, you then start to limit the scope of the BroadSearch feature to the desired applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
        <div id="settings" class="col-sm-12 new-sub-section">
          <h2>1.6 Settings</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>When the user first logs into the Hub application, they will see a settings page for all applications.</p>
          <p>Here you can see the settings page. This is an example of a user only having the first two integrations enabled. </p>
          <p>Once an integration is enabled, the blue slider toggles to “ON” and more details become available. You can then click the “Launch” button to navigate to the integration micro app view.</p>
          <p>You can also toggle where you want the application data displayed. By disabling contextual, your data will no longer be available in the contextual view. By disabling notifications, you will disable the notification counts and updates. Disabling this does not remove the application from the notifications panel entirely as it will still be used when a user clicks the application icon corresponding the affected application and Hub navigates them to the micro app view for that application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-3"><img src="assets/images/image12.png" class="doc-image"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
        <div class="col-sm-11">
          <p>The user can also view which account is linked to this integration. This is helpful if you want to determine where the data is coming from in the case where a user might have multiple accounts for a single application. A good example of this is gmail personal email and gmail corporate email being managed by the same user.</p>

          <p>XSS is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities.</p>
          <p>Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" class="plistHeading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a>

          <h4 class="plistHeading">CSRF</h4>
          <p>Another common JavaScript security vulnerability is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This is something your app should prevent.</p>
          <p>Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" class="plistHeading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery</a>

        <div class="col-sm-11">
          <h4 class="plistHeading">CORS</h4>
          <p>Where applicable, your app should have restricted CORS (Cross origin resource sharing) domains. This will prevent unwanted requests from unwanted domains. Since our Hub servers will send requests to your server, you will need to whitelist the sandbox, staging and production urls for Hub.</p>
          <p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.A web page may freely embed images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, videos and some plugin content (such as Adobe Flash) from any other domain. However, embedded web fonts and AJAX(XMLHttpRequest) requests have traditionally been limited to accessing the same domain as the parent web page (as per the same-origin security policy). "Cross-domain" AJAX requests are forbidden by default because of their ability to perform advanced requests (POST, PUT, DELETE and other types of HTTP requests, along with specifying custom HTTP headers) that introduce many cross-site scripting security issues.</p>
          <p>CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine safely whether or not to allow the cross-origin request. It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests. It is a recommended standard of the W3C.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" class="plistHeading">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing</a>

          <p>We recommend that you follow standard logging practices for your application. This should involve logging to a file on your servers. Any client side logging must be limited for the production level app as it will be shown to the user if the inspect their chrome console. Take care not to log any sensitive data.</p>
          <p>However, you need to make sure that you are not logging excessively as you can crash Hub with an infinite loop of log statements. If your app causes performance issues or impacts performance negatively in any way, your application will be blacklisted from Hub.

          <h4 class="plistHeading">2.8.1 Contextual and Notifications</h4>
          <p>When Hub sends your application a request for data in contextual and notifications, there is an option you return called “refreshAt” (See section 4). This property will tel Hub when to next fetch data from your application in order to refresh the contextual panel for the user and the notifications count.</p>
          <h4 class="plistHeading">2.8.2 MicroApp</h4>
          <p>You have complete control of when the iframe for your micro app refreshes. The best practice is to update the data when new user data becomes available. It is standard practice to do this with websockets. The screen should never flicker with new data and you should never see the page reload. Rather the data should just update as it becomes available to the user.</p>

This can take place in the form of a more button that the user clicks or from a scrolling action of the user when they scroll to the bottom of the available results. </p>
          <p>This is in place as there are several apps loading data and it is better to only serve a small set of results to limit user bandwidth and increase performance while loading the application initially.</p>

While you are filtering your front end results, you should also search your backend for the data as well and once the results come back from your server, you will need to merge the two searches.</p>

          <p>As a developer, you are to send and receive secure requests. The way this works is that Hub will request a secure key on a per user basis. This key can be any string that you wish to send to Hub. Hub will then send this string back to your application for this user each time secure interactions are required. However, if it is actual user data, such as an access_token or a secure key, we recommend that you encrypt this key before sending it to us.</p>
          <p>Once you inform Hub of the key and associated user, we will then send requests back to you with that same key. This is how you will determine if it is a secure request.</p>

          <p>Hub supports OAuth 2.0, which allows you to log the user into your application with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. and you may then want to send us the unique id that matches one of these services. For instance, if your login flow produces some sort of user token, you could then encrypt that token and send it to Hub. Hub will then send you that token back verbatim on each request and it will be your responsibility to decrypt and verify that key. This will ensure that the request to your server is actually coming from Hub and not a malicious source.</p>

          <p>Another example is where you may just want a custom auth token that you use to validate with Hub. This custom token can literally be any string you wish. Some sample ideas for this token could be the username, user’s email, a timestamp of the first interaction with Hub or even just a static string encrypted with a secret only your application knows. This is a less secure mechanism but it may fit your needs better depending on your application.  </p>
          <p>You can encode these tokens in any way you wish. The following examples are encrypted with base64 encoding:</p>
